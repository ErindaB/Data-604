    "A random seed in simulation  is a starting point when you generate random numbers. If you use the same seed you get the same random numbers.For example in Python, if you use seed(123) and then generate some random numbers they will be the same with the ones you generate later on but with the same seed (123).\n",
    "This is very useful because if an experiment uses random numbers and we want to repeat the same experiment different times, then weâ€™ll need the same random numbers.\n",
